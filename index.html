            <p>I want this blog to be like a diary where I can leave a mark of 
                everything I do so that I know my achievements, and possibly 
                have some help if I need it.</p>
            <p>
                I will speak about my travels, climbing (the sport I practice), 
                school, hobbies, projects and everything that comes to my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                This blog itself is one of the projects I am doing now, and I
                 will continue to update the site and blog about it.

                    <p>I finally decided to create a website!</p>
                    <p>I always wanted to have a blog and I finally convinced myself 
                        to create one. I wanted to cut down costs and for this reason 
                        I convinced myself to take advantage of this situation to learn 
                        HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>The website is obviously still a lot rough, I have to implement 
                        new posts from the command line, I dont have comments, and a lot 
                        of features I would like to have are still not there. For this 
                        reason I ask for help! If you are a programmer and you would like 
                        to help me by giving me advice, you are more than welcome, just text 
                        me at paoloslifeblog@gmail.com and I will be more than happy to answer!</p>
